# Alfred PKManager

A handy **Alfred Workflow** which helps to manage your Personal Knowledge Markdown notes.



## Main Features

- Search
    - Search Notes: Search by title, keywords, tags or synonyms (which need to be predefined in YMAL [metadata](#How to set templates?)).
    - Search Snippets: Search by code's language and keywords
- Show Links and Backlinks
    - Show Links: Show Markdown links contained in the current notes.
    - Show Backlinks: Show which note links to the current one. It's an interesting feature motivated by [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
    - **Note**: To avoid syntax issues when using symbol `[[ ]]` in [Typora](https://typora.io), this workflow will search through all the notes for Markdown links ( `[xx](../xx.md)` with a relative path) and use these to process notes' internal connections.
- Create notes with templates
  - Templates: Note, Todo, Snippet, Journal (with location and weather automatically logged)
  - Support customized templates.
- Others
    - Auto-update lookups of synonyms, Markdown links, backlinks ...
    - Manually refresh the Markdown YAML metadata.



## Usage

### How to configure preference?

- First, please set the Workflow variables.

    - `notes_path`: dir of your notes. Only one folder is allowed.

        - It's highly recommended to put all your notes into one folder and give it a unique time ID (e.g. 20200824181348).
        - Check out [this](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#knowledge-management) blog to learn how to use the method of Zettelkasten to handle your knowledge management.

    - `files_path`: dir of your whole files. It supports multi directories which include sub-folders.

        - In case you really need multi folders, here is the solution. 
        - Use comma `,` to separate your paths.
        - Shallow your folder's depth to enhance searching performance.

    - <details>

### How to preset notes and templates?

- <details>
    <summary>Set the metadata of your notes ( Click to expand! )</summary>


    - `metadata`: A YAML frontier placed at the beginning of the Markdown document between two triple dashes. It defines some important infos which will be used in searching.

    - Example:

        ```yaml
        ---
        title: An Example
        synonyms: [tmp]
        tags: [test, python]
        hidden: False
        typora-root-url: ..
        typora-copy-images-to: ../images
        date: 2020-03-19 04:07:28
        updated: 2020-08-02 14:17:46
        ---
        
        Your note content.
        ```

    - `hidden`: Set to "True" to hide/block specific notes from searching result.

    - `synonyms`: Define a list of synonyms for current note's title, which helps to find out the same notes when using different keywords/abbreviations.

        - Example: If you create a Note with title `test` and with `synonyms: [tmp, ÊµãËØï]` in YAML metadata, you can get the exact same note when you search for "test", "tmp" or "ÊµãËØï".
            </details>

- Set your templates:

    - Select `Open templates folder` in `PKManger Configuration`. Customize the templates in the folder or place your own template in it.
    - When you type `n_` to create a new file, the workflow will load your templates and update your config automatically.
    - You can modify the default templates, and they'll be restored when you delete any of them.


### How to search?
