# PKManager - Personal Knowledge Manager

A handy **Alfred Workflow** which helps to manage your personal knowledge Markdown notes.



## Main Features:

- Search and open different type of your Markdown files with ease.
    - Notes: Search by title, keywords or tags.
    - Synonyms Redirect: Synonyms is defined in YMAL metadata, which helps to find out the same notes with different keywords.
        - For example, if you create a Note with title `test` and with `synonyms: [tmp, ÊµãËØï]` in YAML metadata, you can get the exact same note when you search for "test", "tmp" or "ÊµãËØï".
    - Snippets: Search by code's language and keywords
    - Backlinks: To show which note links to the current one. It's an interesting feature motivated by [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
        - We use Markdown links `[name](../xx.md)` with a relative path to capture notes' internal connections (and this can avoid syntax issues when using `[[ ]]` ).
        - You can also show every links contained in the current note.
- Create notes with templates
  - Templates: Note, Todo, Snippet, Journal (with location and weather automatically logged)
  - Customized templates are supported.
- Others
    - Auto-update lookups of synonyms, Markdown links, backlinks ...
    - Manually refresh the Markdown YAML metadata.

### How to configure preference?

- Set Workflow variables

    - `notes_path`: dir of your notes. Only one folder is allowed.
      - It's highly recommended to put all your notes into one folder and give it a unique time ID (e.g. 20200824181348).
      - Check out [this](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#knowledge-management) blog to learn how to use the method of Zettelkasten to handle your knowledge management.

    - `files_path`: dir of your whole files. It supports multi directories which include sub-folders.
      - In case you really need multi folders, here is the solution. Use comma `,` to separate your paths.
      - Shallow your folder's depth to enhance searching performance.

## Acknowledgement

- Many thanks to the project [`Alfred Markdown Notes`](https://github.com/Acidham/alfred-markdown-notes) ! It's a fantastic workflow but just sadly does not support searching in subdirectories ([ Issue #1](https://github.com/Acidham/alfred-markdown-notes/issues/1#issuecomment-489371014)). Instead of cloning the whole project ( its python code looks too decoupled for me), I decided to partly adopt and refactor its code, which make it much easier to add my own customized features.
